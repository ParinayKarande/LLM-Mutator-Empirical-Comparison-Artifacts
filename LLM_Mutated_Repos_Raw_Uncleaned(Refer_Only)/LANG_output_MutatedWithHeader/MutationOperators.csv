This is a simple increment mutation which theoretically would be not applicable here as we do not have incrementing values directly, but we can simulate it by altering the return in a dummy way:
Here, the increment theoretical operation is not specified, but assume a change occurs if we were retrieving the value and incrementing.
Since we do not have any negative checks in the original, we'll add an example method.
Original would have had a positive return; returns false as inverted.
As a placeholder, add a method that might use math calculations.
A simple mathematical alteration to return 4
Negate Conditionals Mutation - Adding a dummy condition to demonstrate negation
Original logic would return true; here we return false to negate its traditional logic

Void Method Calls Mutation - Adding a method that would traditionally do nothing
Literally does nothing, mutating from potential actions that might have been there

ConcurrentInitializer.java,"Mutated version of ConcurrentInitializer
1. Changed the return type to a potential primitive method
2. A method that may return a null value or an instance
3. Introduced a void method
6. A method that always returns true
7. A method that returns void.
8. A method that returns a false value in another sense
Method that could return statuses as integers.
A new method definition allowing T to be null.
A method to reset the initializer state.
4. Added math operation; this might not directly apply, but we define it conceptually
Increment the status.
5. Method that always returns a boolean
We can say initialization will not fail.
Method that allows checking if initialized, always returns true in context.
Explicit method call to signify completion, no value, hence void return.
Returns false indicating no error (this method could have originally been contextual).
