    void remove(); // Mutation: Changed 'clear()' to 'remove()'

    // Increments: Changed the expected return type and usage of put method
    Object put(K key, V value); // Original

    // Conditionals Boundary: Changed method parameter type to a non-compatible type

    // Primitive Returns: Changed return type to primitive if applicable, adjusted accordingly

        return 0; // Mutation: returns a primitive value
    }

    // True Returns: Mutated put method to always return true for any given input
