CSVException.java,"Mutation 1: Empty Returns
Note: The constructor cannot return a value, so we don't mutate here.
Mutation 2: Void Method Calls
This mutation doesn't apply to the constructor itself, so we will not mutate.
Mutation 3: Null Returns
Constructors cannot have return values, so no mutations here.
Mutation 4: Inverts Negative Conditions
This is not applicable because the constructor logic does not contain conditions.
Mutation 5: Negate Conditionals
No conditionals in the constructor.
Mutation 6: Different Conditions
Change method behavior (though this isn't method-and-condition based, we will alter behavior):
Mutation 7: False Returns
Not applicable, constructors do not return values.
Mutation 8: True Returns
Not applicable, constructors do not return values.
Mutation 9: Increment
As this class does not have numerical variables to increment.
Mutation 10: Math Mutations
Additional Mutations:
Mutation 11: Return Values
Not applicable. Constructors do not return values.
Conditionals Boundary
Replacing String.format with a custom method to manipulate the output
Custom formatting as a Math variant
Placeholder, could add math operations here
"
CSVParser.java,"Incremented to 2 instead of 1 (Increment Operator)
Inverted value to -recordNumber (Invert Negatives)
Negate Conditionals operator (return true instead of false)
Changed the exception message
Void Method Call operator (calling close here)
Changed to 0 instead of 1 (Return Values operator)
Adding a constant ""default"" if the input is null (Empty Returns operator)
Null Returns operator (adding a null return at the end of close method)
Returning empty instead of null (Empty Returns operator)
Changed to return 0 instead of recordNumber (Primitive Returns operator)
Negated conditionals operator (made it return false if trailerComment is not present)
Changed the message to ""Parsing error encountered"" (not a critical change, just for the sake of diversity)
